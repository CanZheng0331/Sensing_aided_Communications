# 感知辅助通信 Sensing-Aided Communications

## NEWS: Showing the newly updated source code
**2024.12.26:** S. Jiang and A. Alkhateeb, **"Computer Vision Aided Beam Tracking in A Real-World Millimeter Wave Deployment,"** in IEEE Globecom Workshops, 2022. <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10008648>.

## 1 Motivation
I’m interested in sensing-aided communication research, especially with the DeepSense 6G dataset from WILAB, Arizona State University (https://www.wi-lab.net/). While there is open-source code available, it still takes time to get started. To make learning easier for myself and others, I’m using Google Colab to write code and achieve a “one-click run” for easy execution without setup. Note that reproducing will not cover all papers, but will select some that I am interested in or can use.

## 2 How to Start
All you need to do is run .ipynb file(s) on Google Colab.
